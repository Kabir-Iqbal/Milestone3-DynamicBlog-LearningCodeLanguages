    How CSS Works
    CSS operates through a system of rules that target specific HTML elements and define their styles. These rules consist of selectors (which specify the elements to style) and declarations (which define the style properties and their values). For example, you might define a style rule to make all paragraph text blue or to center-align all images.
    
    Core Features of CSS:
    - **Text Styling:** CSS allows customization of fonts, colors, sizes, spacing, and alignment. Developers can choose specific fonts, control line heights, and define letter spacing to create visually appealing text layouts.
    - **Layouts and Positioning:** CSS provides tools to organize elements on a page. Developers can create flexible layouts using techniques like Flexbox and Grid, position elements precisely, and ensure that designs adapt to different screen sizes.
    - **Colors and Backgrounds:** CSS enables the use of custom colors, gradients, and images as backgrounds, contributing to unique and visually appealing designs.
    - **Borders and Spacing:** Developers can define margins, padding, and borders to control the spacing and separation of elements, ensuring a well-structured layout.
    - **Animations and Transitions:** CSS allows the creation of animations and smooth transitions, adding interactivity and visual appeal to web pages.
    - **Media Queries:** These enable responsive designs by applying specific styles based on screen size, resolution, or orientation, ensuring the website looks great on all devices.
